[Part I: Bombs in the Ville]

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I want to lock it down, make time for you
Chocolate brown, what sign are you?
I don't know, but I got a feelin' that can't be stopped
Hugged up with you in the parkin' lot
Outside the whip with my shit on a rock
Lips so soft with the strawberry gloss
You make a nigga fall like a Marbury cross
Late-night calls, I got calls to cut off my broads for you
Great-white shark just like Jaws, I'll rock the boat for you

[Chorus]
I got high hopes for you, yeah (For you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
I got high hopes for you, mhm (For you, for you, for you, for you, for you)

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm a star (Yeah), but I'd never shine (Feel that)
Built the tallest wall, come and see behind (Come feel that)
Bombs in The Ville, violent all the times (I feel that)
When the smoke clears, you is who I'll find
Let's run away (Let's run away, let's run away-ay-ay)
Heard somebody said they on top now? I'll pull up to see if you there
I've been countin' up M's in the background, still movin' low-key, I'm rare
Remember the spot you met me? I'll pull up to see if you there
I was hopin' you ain't forget me (Forget me)

[Part II: Hit the Gas]

[Interlude]
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Hittin' the gas is not somethin' I do (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Had to match the braids 'cause I was too (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Fucked up in the head, I felt confused (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Sure glad I ran back into you (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
I was scared you found somebody new (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Ran off and had a child or two (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
I know I said I wasn't gon' change (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
But all the past done allowed my ways (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Focus up, nigga, I'm goin' through things, goin' through things (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Goin' through things, goin' through things (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Times not slowin' down (Focus up, nigga, I'm goin' through things, goin' through things)
We need you around (Goin' through things, goin' through things)
I need you around, around (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
Fuck with your nigga, I'm goin' through things
Grey hairs on my head, mean I know a few things
I bought a iPhone that travels through time
FaceTime done got younger me on the line
Soon as he saw me he just started cryin'
I told him, "Relax, everythin' gon' be fine"
He wiped off his face and said he tryna be strong
But some days he feel like he doin' it wrong
I told him, "Hold on," and passed out my phone to my oldest son
And my youngest one said, "I want you to look them straight in their face
Do that look like you've been makin' mistakes?"
Fame is a drug, you was chosen to take
Unfortunately, can't be sober and great
You're just like a flower the world wanna hold
They sniff on your petals until you get old
And then they dispose, a new flower grows
Can't take it personal, that's just how it go
Soon you gon' know that your high comin' down
And that's the point that I'll call you from now
This is The Fall-Off, I'm fallin' off, how?
The rappers do when they can't find a new sound
Missin' the day they was hotter year 'round
But life is a film that cannot be rewound
[Outro]
(Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
(Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
(Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
(Rewound, cannot be rewound)
