Yeah
I want to lock it down,
make time for you
Chocolate brown, what sign are you?
I don't know, but I got
a feelin' that can't be stopped
Hugged up with you in the parkin' lot
Outside the whip with my shit on a rock
Lips so soft with the strawberry gloss
You make a nigga fall
like a Marberry cross
Late-night calls,
I got calls to cut off my broads for you
Great-white shark just like Jaws,
I'll rock the boat for you
I got high hopes for you, yeah
(For you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
I got high hopes for you, mhm
(For you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
Bitch, I'm a star (Yeah),
but I'd never shine (Know that)
Built the tallest wall,
come and see behind (Come feel that)
Bombs in The Ville,
violent all the times (I feel that)
When the smoke clears,
you is who I'll find
Let's run away
(Let's run away, let's run away-ay-ay)
Heard somebody said they on top now?
I'll pull up to see if you there
I've been countin' up M's
in the background,
still movin' low-key, I'm rare
Remember the spot you met me?
I'll pull up to see if you there
I was hopin' you ain't forget me
(Forget me)
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
And the girls is not somethin' I do
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Had the master braids 'cause I was too
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Fucked up in the head, I felt confused
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Sure glad I ran back into you
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
I was scared you found somebody new
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Ran off and had a child or two
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
I know I said I wasn't gon' shave
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
But all the past done allowed my ways
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Focus up, nigga,
I'm goin' through things,
goin' through things
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Goin' through things, goin' through things
(Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn,
gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
Times not slowing down
(Focus up, nigga,
I'm goin' through things,
goin' through things)
We need you around
(Goin' through things,
goin' through things)
I need you around, around
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, yeah
Fuck with your nigga,
I'm goin' through things
Grey hairs on my head,
mean I know a few things
I bought a iPhone that travels
through time
FaceTime done got younger me
on the line
Soon as he saw me he
just started cryin'
I told him, "Relax,
everythin' gon' be fine"
He wiped off his face
and said he tryna be strong
But some days he feel like
he doin' it wrong
I told him, "Hold on,"
and passed out my phone
to my oldest son
And my youngest one said,
I want you to look them
straight in their face
Do that look like you've been
makin' mistakes?
Fame is a drug,
you was chosen to take
Unfortunately,
can't be sober and great
You're just like a flower
the world wanna hold
They sniff on your petals
until you get old
And then they dispose,
a new flower grows
Can't take a person,
that's just how it go
Soon you gon' know
that your high comin' down
And that's the point
that I'll call you from now
This is The Fall-Off,
I'm fallin' off, how?
The rappers do
when they can't find a new sound
Missin' the day
they was hotter year 'round
But life is a film
that cannot be rewound
(Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
(Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
(Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
(Rewound, cannot be rewound)
