[00:12.85] Yeah
[00:14.85] 
[00:15.29] I want to lock it down, make time for you
[00:17.14] Chocolate brown, what sign are you?
[00:18.98] I don't know, but I got a feelin' that can't be stopped
[00:22.79] Hugged up with you in the parkin' lot
[00:24.58] Outside the whip with my shit on rock
[00:26.50] Lips so soft with the strawberry gloss
[00:28.45] You make a nigga fall like a Marbury cross
[00:30.30] Late-night calls, I got calls to cut off my broads for you
[00:33.57] Great-white shark just like Jaws, I'll rock the boat for you
[01:03.57] 
[00:37.86] I got high hopes for you, yeah (For you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
[00:41.62] I got high hopes for you, mhm (For you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
[01:19.12] 
[00:45.46] Bitch, I'm a star (Yeah), but I'd never shine (Feel that)
[00:49.17] Built the tallest wall, come and see behind (Come feel that)
[00:52.94] Bombs in The Ville, violent all the times (I feel that)
[00:56.78] When the smoke clears, you is who I'll find
[01:00.50] Let's run away (Let's run away, let's run away-ay-ay)
[01:09.02] Heard somebody said they on top now? I'll pull up to see if you there
[01:12.77] I've been countin' up M's in the background, still movin' low-key, I'm rare
[01:16.53] Remember the spot you met me? I'll pull up to see if you there
[01:20.30] I was hopin' you ain't forget me (Forget me)
[01:42.30] 
[01:42.80] 
[01:24.34] (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[01:29.30] Hittin' the gas is not somethin' I do (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[01:36.21] Had to mash the brakes 'cause I was too (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[01:43.11] Fucked up in the head, I felt confused (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[01:50.14] Sure glad I ran back into you (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[01:57.29] I was scared you found somebody new (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[02:04.34] Ran off and had a child or two (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[02:11.54] I know I said I wasn't gon' change (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[02:18.62] But all the past done allowed my ways (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[02:22.33] Focus up, nigga, I'm goin' through things, goin' through things (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[02:22.96] Goin' through things, goin' through things (Gyatt, damn, she got it, damn, gyatt, damn, she got it, damn)
[02:27.31] Times not slowin' down (Focus up, nigga, I'm goin' through things, goin' through things)
[02:31.41] We need you around (Goin' through things, goin' through things)
[02:34.85] I need you around, around (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[03:05.85] 
[03:04.65] Fuck with your nigga, I'm goin' through things
[03:06.17] Grey hairs on my head, mean I know a few things
[03:07.85] I bought a iPhone that travels through time
[03:09.73] FaceTime done got younger me on the line
[03:11.45] Soon as he saw me he just started cryin'
[03:13.13] I told him, "Relax, everythin' gon' be fine"
[03:14.92] He wiped off his face and said he tryna be strong
[03:16.64] But some days he feel like he doin' it wrong
[03:18.49] I told him, "Hold on," and passed out my phone to my oldest son
[03:20.37] And my youngest one said, "I want you to look them straight in their face
[03:23.80] Do that look like you've been makin' mistakes?"
[03:25.69] Fame is a drug, you was chosen to take
[03:27.48] Unfortunately, can't be sober and great
[03:29.20] You're just like a flower the world wanna hold
[03:30.96] They sniff on your petals until you get old
[03:32.80] And then they dispose, a new flower grows
[03:34.49] Can't take it personal, that's just how it go
[03:36.25] Soon you gon' know that your high comin' down
[03:38.01] And that's the point that I'll call you from now
[03:39.92] This is The Fall-Off, I'm fallin' off, how?
[03:41.76] The rappers do when they can't find a new sound
[03:43.53] Missin' the day they was hotter year 'round
[04:05.03] 
[03:45.33] (Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
[03:49.22] (Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
[03:52.66] (Life is a film that cannot be rewound)
[04:01.61] (Rewound, cannot be rewound)
